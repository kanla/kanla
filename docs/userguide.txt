The kanla User Guide
====================
Michael Stapelberg <michael+kanla@stapelberg.de>
March 2013

kanla is a daemon which periodically checks
whether your website, mail server, etc.
are still up and running.

In case a health check fails,
kanla will notify you
via jabber (XMPP).

Focus of kanla lies on
being light-weight,
being simple,
using a sane configuration file,
being well-documented.

== Introduction

Many people run personal websites
or websites of their pet projects.
Except for professional sysadmins,
none of those I asked
ran any kind of software to notify them about failures.
Since nobody disagreed with me about the idea being helpful,
this suggests that existing software is too complex,
complicated to setup,
under-documented
or for some other reason undesirable.

I myself wanted to be notified
-- by software, not by users --
when http://i3wm.org is not reachable anymore.
However, the software I looked at
could not be configured to verify the actual page contents
(as opposed to only the HTTP status)
and did not even support IPv6
(come on, it’s 2013).

My conclusion was that writing a simple program myself
would be faster than trying to re-implement plugins
for existing monitoring/alerting software
in such a way that I’d be happy with them.

kanla is the fruit of this effort.
It is intentionally simple
and focuses on small-scale alerting.
This means it will *NOT* generate uptime statistics,
or execute certain actions when some condition is met,
or handle pager alerts and on-call schedules.
Instead, it verifies what you describe
and whenever something is wrong,
it sends you a message via jabber (XMPP).

=== Terminology

kanla instance::
	A process of the +kanla+ binary,
	running with precisely one configuration.
	You can have multiple instances running
	and each instance usually has several plugins running.

plugin::
	A small program which verifies that things are good.
	For example, the "http" plugin
	retrieves websites and verifies their content.
	If anything goes wrong
	you will get an alert.

alert::
	The message which kanla sends to you when things go wrong.

== Installation

To install kanla,
you should by all means
use your distribution’s package management system.

It is intentional
that there is no instruction for installing from source.

If there is no package for your distribution,
consider making one.
The Debian packaging serves as reference packaging.

=== Locations

kanla itself should be installed as +/usr/bin/kanla+.

kanla ships with a number of plugins.
To find the plugin location for your system,
use:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
perl -MFile::ShareDir -E 'say File::ShareDir::dist_dir("kanla")'
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Custom plugins can be placed in
+/usr/local/share/kanla/+ or
+/usr/local/lib/kanla/+,
depending on whether they are
binary files or scripts.

A plugin is just an executable file
(implemented in any language, but preferably Perl)
which produces output in a certain format on stderr
when things go wrong.
Plugins are identified by their file name,
e.g. "http".

Configuration files are placed in +/etc/kanla/+
with the default configuration file being named +default.cfg+.
This file
-- by default --
includes every +.cfg+ file in +/etc/kanla/default.d/+
which is where you will find example configurations
for every plugin.

== Configuration

The main kanla configuration file is called +/etc/kanla/default.cfg+.
It contains the jabber (XMPP) account configuration,
the default alert destination (e.g. your jabber id)
and includes +/etc/kanla/default.d/*.cfg+.

After modifying the jabber (XMPP) account configuration,
you need to enable at least one plugin
by removing the comment signs (+#+)
in front of every line of its configuration file.
The provided files serve as a minimum useful example
(while this documentation poses a reference)
and will not change often
so you can modify them
without being bothered by config file conflicts on upgrades.

It goes without saying that configuration files are encoded as UTF-8
and UTF-8 is supported throughout kanla.

[NOTE]
SysVinit will not directly report error messages
when (re)starting kanla.
Ensure kanla is running
by checking +service kanla status+
and/or look at
+/var/log/kanla.log+
for error messages

=== Quick example

*A minimum useful kanla configuration*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<jabber>
    jid      = "kanla@example.com"
    password = "kV9eJ4LZ9KRYOCec5W2witq"
</jabber>

send_alerts_to = <<EOT
michael@example.com
EOT

<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = "http://www.i3wm.org/"
    url    = "http://i3wm.org/"
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Jabber configuration

Jabber configuration is done with one (or multiple) jabber block(s).
Each block needs to have at least the jid and password attribute.
The following attributes can be configured:

jid::
    The jabber id of this account,
    e.g. +kanla@example.com+.
password::
    The password for this account.
host::
    The hostname of the jabber server
    to which to connect to.
    It is normally *NOT* necessary to specify this,
    but some networks actively break SRV record resolution.
port::
    The port of the jabber server, if non-standard.

*Simple jabber example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<jabber>
    jid      = "kanla@example.com"
    password = "kV9eJ4LZ9KRYOCec5W2witq"
</jabber>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Complex jabber example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<jabber>
    jid      = "kanla@example.com"
    password = "kV9eJ4LZ9KRYOCec5W2witq"
</jabber>

<jabber>
    jid      = "kanla@example.net"
    password = "kV9eJ4LZ9KRYOCec5W2witq"
    host     = "jabber.example.net"
    port     = 5222
</jabber>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no default value for this option,
therefore *you have to configure this*.

[NOTE]
kanla will send an
http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0199.html[XEP-0199] ping to the server
every 60 seconds.
If the server does not reply within 60 seconds,
the connection is considered dead
and will be reconnected.

=== Main configuration

==== send_alerts_to

[[send_alerts_to]]

A list of jabber ids (line-separated)
to which alerts will be sent.
This can be overwritten on a per-plugin basis.
Please use the heredoc syntax,
otherwise extending this list
will not work
(a limitation of the http://metacpan.org/module/Config::General[Config::General] module).

*send_alerts_to example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
send_alerts_to = <<EOT
michael@example.com
stefan@example.com
EOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no default value for this option,
therefore *you have to configure this*.

[NOTE]
================================================================================
In order to maximize redundancy,
you can (and should) use multiple jabber ids.
Of course, they should not use the same infrastructure,
so use two different jabber servers
and clients (if possible).

In case you are using Android,
consider using Google Talk (built-in)
and Xabber
(supports http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html[XEP-0184] message receipts)
with a non-google account.
================================================================================

// TODO: are full jids okay?
//////////////////////////////

==== consecutive_failures

[[consecutive_failures]]

Sometimes,
the problem detected by a plugin
is transient.
As an example,
maybe the IRC plugin tries to connect
in precisely the same moment
in which 5 other connections are made
and thus the server’s listen queue is full.
The next check will succeed
and there was only a brief interruption of service
from your user’s point of view,
if at all.
Human intervention is not necessary,
so it would be good
if the human can stay out of the loop entirely.

When setting consecutive_failures
to any value higher than 1 (the default),
kanla will inhibit delivering the plugin’s messages
until that specific failure has occurred
+$consecutive_failures+ times.

Uniquely identifying a specific failure
is the responsibility of the plugin,
see <<example_alert_output>>.

*consecutive_failures example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
consecutive_failures = 2

<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin   = http
    url      = "http://www.i3wm.org/"
    # Effectively notifies me once www.i3wm.org
    # is down for at least 60 seconds.
    interval = 30
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== silenced_by

[[silenced_by]]

The +silenced_by+ directive
has two use cases:

. Inhibit all alerts when the internet connection is down.
. Only send a single alert when an entire machine fails.

The first use case can be accomplished
by monitoring a very reliable target
and using a global +silenced_by+ setting
on that target’s id:

*silenced_by example 1*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
consecutive_failures = 2
silenced_by = http.http://www.google.com

<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = http://www.i3wm.org/
</monitor>

<monitor internet connection check>
    plugin = http
    url    = http://www.google.com
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
================================================================================
To avoid race conditions,
it is a good idea to use
+consecutive_failures = 2+
and have +interval+ settings
that ensure the reliable site is
checked at least as often as the
other targets.
Otherwise,
the +silenced_by+ setting
might not have any effect,
because the error for the reliable site
might arrive *after*
the error for the unreliable site.
================================================================================

=== Plugin configuration

There are some configuration directives which are valid for every plugin.
These directives are:

plugin::
    Specifies which plugin should be used.
    This is simply the base filename of the plugin,
    e.g. "http".
send_alerts_to::
    Overwrites the main configuration’s send_alerts_to
    for this plugin,
    see <<send_alerts_to>>.
    Using variables, you can also amend instead of overwrite,
    see <<variables>>.
interval::
    Controls how often the plugin verifies that things are good.
    This configuration directive is merely a convention,
    that is, plugins don’t *have to* use it
    (e.g. in case the plugin needs a more detailed interval configuration),
    but it is strongly recommended.
silenced_by::
    All plugin output is discarded
    while the specified id is present.
    See <<silenced_by>>.

=== Plugin: http

The http plugin periodically retrieves the specified URL(s)
and sends alerts if the HTTP status is not 200
or anything else went wrong during retrieval.

==== URL

The URL of the site to retrieve.
This can be anything which the
http://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::HTTP[AnyEvent::HTTP] module accepts.
In addition
it allows to embed username and password
for HTTP basic access authentication.
The http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2[standard URI syntax] is used,
e.g. +http://user:pass@www.i3wm.org/+.

You can specify this configuration directive multiple times.

*Full URL example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = "http://www.i3wm.org/"
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no default value for this option,
therefore *you have to configure this*.

You can specify multiple URLs:

*Multiple URL example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = http://www.i3wm.org/
    url    = http://www.i3-wm.org/
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Family

[[http-family]]

The address family
(IPv4, IPv6 or both)
which should be used when retrieving the URL(s).

The default is to try both IPv4 and IPv6.

*Full family example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    family = ipv4 | ipv6
    url    = "http://www.i3wm.org/"
</monitor>

<monitor slashdot>
    plugin = http
    # slashdot doesn’t even support IPv6…
    family = ipv4
    url    = "http://slashdot.org/"
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
The absence of a AAAA DNS record is treated as an error
(to catch DNS misconfiguration problems).
Therefore, if your site is IPv4-only,
you need to explicitly configure that.
This is intentional --
it’s 2013,
your site should really be dual-stacked by now.

==== Body

[[http-body]]

You can make kanla verify
the page it received via HTTP
actually contains expected content.
That is,
sometimes webservers fail even though
they return the HTTP 200 status,
for example
because a poorly written PHP script
could not establish a database connection.

You can specify this option multiple times,
all specified checks need to pass.

You can either specify a
http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html[Perl regular expression]
(e.g. +/foo/+,
it *MUST* be enclosed in forward slashes)
or a custom verification function
(*MUST* start with "sub {"),
see the example below.
Functions will be called with the
full HTTP body string
as first argument.

This option has no default value,
meaning no checks on the body are performed.

*Full body example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = "http://www.i3wm.org/"

    # Check for the intro text.
    body   = "/tiling window manager/"

    # Check for version 4.x in the page.
    body   = <<EOT
/4.\d<\/span>/
EOT
</monitor>

<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin = http
    url    = "http://www.i3wm.org/"

    # Stupid check for the length of the returned page.
    # Only good for demonstration purposes.
    # Note how variables need to be escaped because
    # otherwise they are interpolated.
    body   = <<EOT
sub {
    my (\$body) = @_;
    return (length(\$body) == 5137);
}
EOT
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Plugin: smtp

The smtp plugin periodically connects to an SMTP server
and sends alerts
if the server does not send the SMTP greeting
(220 …)
within 20 seconds after connecting
or anything else went wrong on the DNS/TCP level.

==== Host

The host
(may include a port)
of the smtp server to check.
Every syntax which
https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::Socket[AnyEvent::Socket]’s
parse_hostport function understands is accepted
(this covers all common IPv4 and IPv6 formats).

You can specify this configuration directive multiple times.

*Full Host example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3 smtp>
    plugin = smtp
    host   = infra.in.zekjur.net
</monitor>

<monitor i3 smtp>
    plugin = smtp
    family = ipv6
    host   = "[2001:4d88:100e:1::2]:submission"
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Family

See <<http-family>>.

==== Timeout

[[smtp-timeout]]

The timeout (in seconds) for
each connection attempt (via TCP)
and for receiving the greeting.

The default value is a timeout 20 seconds.
This means it is okay if the TCP connection
can be established after 9 seconds
and the SMTP greeting is read after another 9 seconds.

*Full timeout example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3 smtp>
    plugin   = smtp

    # Gee, we could really use some newer hardware.
    # Until then, cut the server some slack:
    # Check only every 5 minutes,
    # wait up to 60 seconds for connections
    # and for reading the greeting.
    timeout  = 60
    interval = 300

    host     = infra.in.zekjur.net
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Plugin: irc

The irc plugin periodically logs onto an IRC network
and sends alerts
if the server does not let you log in properly
(it looks for the "001" IRC message)
or anything else went wrong on the DNS/TCP level.

==== ircd

The host
(may include a port)
of the IRC server to check.
Every syntax which
https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::Socket[AnyEvent::Socket]’s
parse_hostport function understands is accepted
(this covers all common IPv4 and IPv6 formats).

*Full ircd example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor TWiCEiRC>
    plugin = irc
    ircd   = irc.twice-irc.de
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Family

See <<http-family>>.

==== Timeout

See <<smtp-timeout>>.

=== Plugin: git

The git plugin periodically checks
whether the specified git URL
works correctly
(by receiving the current HEAD revision)
and sends alerts
if anything comes back which does not look like a git HEAD revision
or anything else went wrong on the DNS/TCP level.

==== url

A git URL
of the git-daemon to check.
Every syntax which
https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::Socket[AnyEvent::Socket]’s
parse_hostport function understands is accepted
(this covers all common IPv4 and IPv6 formats).

*Full url example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor i3 git>
    plugin = git
    url    = git://code.i3wm.org/i3
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Family

See <<http-family>>.

==== Timeout

See <<smtp-timeout>>.

=== Plugin: redis

The redis plugin periodically connects to a redis server
and sends alerts
if the server does not respond to a PING command (with `+PONG`)
or anything else went wrong on the DNS/TCP level.

==== Host

The host (may include a port)
of the redis server to check.
Every syntax which
https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::Socket[AnyEvent::Socket]’s
parse_hostport function understands is accepted
(this covers all common IPv4 and IPv6 formats).

You can specify this configuration directive multiple times.

*Full Host example*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor my redis>
    plugin = redis
    host   = localhost:6379
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Family

See <<http-family>>.
Make sure to use `family = ipv4` here
as long as redis does not support IPv6.

== Config recipes

=== Variables

[[variables]]

When configuring many hosts which are alike,
variables might come in handy.
kanla enables http://metacpan.org/module/Config::General::Interpolated[Config::General::Interpolated],
so you can use variables
by refering to configuration directives
with a dollar sign prefixed,
e.g. +$send_alerts_to+ evaluates to the contents
of the send_alerts_to directive.

You are not confined to the directives which actually exist,
but you can use any key/value pair you want.
To avoid troubles, you should prefix your own directives with an underscore.
kanla will never implement directives starting with an underscore.

*Amending send_alerts_to*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# michael@example.com gets ALL the alerts!
send_alerts_to = <<EOT
michael@example.com
EOT

<monitor i3wm website>
    plugin         = http
    url            = "http://www.i3wm.org/"

    # Additionally, alert stefan@example.com.
    send_alerts_to = <<EOT
    $send_alerts_to
    stefan@example.com
    EOT
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Monitor multiple trac instances* (+/etc/kanla/default.cfg+):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_trac_url = "bugs.i3wm.org"
include "default.d/http-trac.cfg"

_trac_url = "trac.edgewall.org"
include "default.d/http-trac.cfg"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Monitor multiple trac instances* (+/etc/kanla/default.d/http-trac.cfg+):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<monitor trac at $_trac_url>
    plugin = http
    url    = $_trac_url
# TODO: content matching
</monitor>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Technical details

=== Message receipts

kanla supports jabber’s http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html[XEP-0184] message receipts.
With message receipts,
delivery of a message is confirmed end-to-end,
that is, kanla can be sure your device received its message.
More importantly, when your device does not confirm the message,
kanla will retry (after 30 seconds) to send the message,
until your device confirms the message.

You will immediately notice this feature
when you configure multiple jabber accounts.
In that case, kanla will try to deliver alerts
using one jabber account first,
and if that fails, it retries with the second one.
In case you have more than two accounts,
this is repeated until
your device confirmed the message or
there are no accounts left.

For +send_alerts_to+ destinations which do not support XEP-0184,
kanla will immediately send alerts from all jabber accounts.
This leads to a storm of alerts on your device,
but this is intended to keep things simple.
Lobby your jabber client vendor to implement XEP-0184,
it’s simple enough.

=== Jabber presences

Let’s assume you configure +michael@example.com+ via +send_alerts_to+
and you are connected as +michael@example.com+
on your computer
and on your smartphone.
Jabber calls each of these connections a presence.

When sending an alert to +michael@example.com+,
kanla will chose the presence with the highest priority.
In case multiple presences have the same priority,
one of them will be arbitrarily chosen.

By changing the priority in your jabber client(s),
you can therefore influence where alerts should go.

=== Writing plugins

The recommended way
to write plugins
is to write them in Perl and
 use the Perl module +Kanla::Plugin+.
This module sets up
some useful imports,
the signal_error function,
configuration parsing
and a main timer.
The only thing you have to write yourself
is a function called +run+,
which will be invoked regularly.

Additionally,
if the service you are monitoring
works in a banner-like way
(e.g. you connect,
possibly write some data,
then read some data),
you can use +Kanla::Plugin::Banner+.
This module establishes a connection
when you call +banner_connect+
and takes care of everything:
resolving the host,
connecting to the resolved addresses,
raising errors on timeouts.

For an example of
using these modules,
check the “git” plugin.

Of course,
plugins can be implemented
in any language.
See the next section
for details.

=== Plugin interface

Plugins are executable files
which run for an indefinite amount of time.
When they exit,
regardless of their exit status,
they will be restarted
after 2 seconds.

On stdin,
plugins get their configuration.
The plugin’s
stdout and stderr
is not interpreted by kanla.

On file descriptor 3,
plugins send alerts,
formatted as JSON.

==== Example configuration input

The configuration for plugins
is dumped by +Config::General+.

Here is the http plugin’s
example configuration
as sent to the plugin via stdin:

*Example configuration input*:
-------------------------------------------
plugin   http
family   ipv4
url   http://slashdot.org/
-------------------------------------------

Given that the config is generated by +Config::General+,
it is of course the best idea to use that module
to read the configuration, too.
However, this is not required and,
especially if you are using
a different language than Perl,
parsing this key/value format using
regular expressions should work fine.

==== Example alert output

[[example_alert_output]]

Each message is represented by a JSON hash.
Currently,
only three keys are defined:

severity::
The severity of the message.
Note that kanla currently ignores this.
message::
A free text message
which will be sent to
the configured send_alerts_to destination.
Make this as helpful as possible,
but keep it as verbose as necessary.
id::
A unique id
for this specific problem.
Used in order to suppress messages
unless the problem persists.
Should start with
the plugin name,
e.g.
http.http://i3wm.org/.404


*Example alert JSON output*:
-------------------------------------------
{
 "severity": "critical",
 "message": "This will be sent via Jabber",
 "id": "doc.userguide.example"
}
-------------------------------------------
